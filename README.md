# R for applied epidemiology and public health

This handbook strives to:

-   Serve as a quick R code reference manual
-   Provide task-centered examples addressing common epidemiological problems
-   Assist epidemiologists transitioning to R
-   The Epidemiologist R Handbook

Other points: 

- This is a code reference book accompanied by relatively brief examples, not a thorough textbook on R or data science 
- This is a R handbook for use within applied epidemiology, not a manual on the methods or science of applied epidemiology 
- This is intended to be a living document optimal R packages for a given task change often and we welcome discussion about which to emphasize in this handbook
